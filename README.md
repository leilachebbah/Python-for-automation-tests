# Python-for-automation-tests

Automation of tests is an important aspect of software development, as it allows developers to quickly and easily verify that their code is working as intended. One popular language for automation testing is Python, which offers a wide range of libraries and tools for automating various types of tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. With Python, developers can write test scripts that are easy to read, understand, and maintain, making it a great choice for automating tests throughout the software development process. Whether you are new to automation testing or are looking to expand your skills in this area, Python is a powerful tool that can help you create robust, reliable test scripts that can save you time and improve the overall quality of your code.

Here are the general steps to automate tests with Python:

Install the necessary libraries and tools: The first step is to install Python on your computer, as well as any libraries and tools that you will need for your specific type of test automation. For example, you may need to install the unittest or pytest library for unit testing, or the Selenium or Splinter library for web browser automation.

Write your test scripts: Once you have the necessary libraries and tools installed, you can start writing your test scripts. This typically involves creating test functions or methods that define the specific actions that you want to test, such as checking that a certain button or link is present on a web page, or that a certain function or method returns the expected result.

Run your test scripts: Once you have written your test scripts, you can run them to see if they pass or fail. This is typically done using a test runner, such as the one included with the unittest or pytest library. The test runner will execute each test and report any failures or errors that it encounters.

Analyze the results: After your test scripts have run, you will need to analyze the results to see if any tests failed and why. This typically involves looking at the test output and any error messages that were generated, as well as reviewing the code and test scripts to determine the cause of the failure.

Iterate and improve: Finally, you will want to iterate and improve your test scripts as needed. This may involve making changes to the code or test scripts, or adding new test cases to cover additional functionality or edge cases.

It's worth mentioning that these are the general steps, different libraries and frameworks may have different ways of organizing, running, and analyzing the tests.

for the first step we have to install some tools for the automation web browser tests: Selenium: Selenium is a widely used library for automating web browsers. It allows you to interact with web pages, such as filling in forms, clicking buttons, and navigating between pages. Selenium supports multiple web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, and can be used with a variety of programming languages, including Python.

Splinter: Splinter is a Python library that sits on top of Selenium, providing a higher-level API for web browser automation. It allows you to interact with web pages in a more intuitive and user-friendly way, making it easier to write test scripts.

Pytest-Selenium: Pytest-Selenium is a plugin for the Pytest testing framework that provides support for Selenium. It allows you to write tests using the Pytest syntax, which can make test scripts more readable and maintainable.

WebDriver: Selenium uses a web driver to communicate with the browser. You will need to install the appropriate driver for the browser you want to automate, for example the Chrome Driver for Chrome, or the GeckoDriver for Firefox.

Browser: The browser you want to automate.

Additional libraries: Depending on the specific needs of your test automation, you may also need to install additional libraries, such as requests for making HTTP requests, or Beautiful Soup for parsing HTML and XML documents.

It's important to note that some of these libraries and tools are dependent on each other, so you should make sure that you have the right version of each one installed.

If you are new to automation testing with python and have never programmed with python, here are some steps to learn Python for automation testing:

Learn the basics of Python: If you are new to Python, the first step is to learn the basics of the language. This includes learning the syntax, data types, control structures, and basic built-in functions. You can find many resources online such as tutorials, videos, and interactive coding exercises to help you get started. (Learn Pyhton with w3schools, Learn by using the official source of Python)

Get familiar with test automation frameworks: Once you have a good understanding of the basics of Python, you can start learning about test automation frameworks such as unittest here, pytest here, or nose here. These frameworks provide a structure and set of tools for writing, running, and analyzing test scripts.

Learn the libraries used for automation: Learn how to use libraries like Selenium and Splinter for web browser automation and other libraries like requests, BeautifulSoupfor web scraping and parsing.

Practice writing test scripts: Practice writing test scripts for a variety of different scenarios. This will help you to become more familiar with the syntax and structure of test scripts, as well as the different types of tests that you can automate.

Learn best practices: Learn best practices for writing and maintaining test scripts, such as how to organize your code, how to handle test data, and how to debug and troubleshoot test failures.

Here are a few links that can help you learn best practices for writing and maintaining test scripts:
